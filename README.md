## Hangman
This project is a simple word guessing game called the Hangman. In order to win you must correctly guess the randomly generated keyword before the image of a hanged man is completed.

## Setup
Make sure you have Java (JDK 8+) installed by typing  
```java -version```  
in the command prompt.  
If not, go to https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html and follow the instructions.  
Once that's done, start by creating a new directory where you want the files to be located.  
Open the command prompt in the created directory and run this command:  
```git clone https://github.com/zaskul/Hangman```  
Change current directory to the cloned one using:  
```cd Hangman```  
To run the app, use the following command:  
```java -cp out\production\Hangman Hangman```  
or simply open the project in IntelliJ IDEA, then build and run the Hangman.java file located in the src directory
